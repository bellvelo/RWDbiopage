                <p>This is my first attempt at a responsive webpage. I used a tutorial I found on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>.
                    I realise there are many ways to the top of the mountain with regards to responsiveness. I shall explore the other 
                    options, along with <em>Bootstrap.</em></p>

                <h1 id="Career">career to date</h1>
                    <p>Prior to joining the <strong>CodeClan</strong> course, I have been a full time parent for the last 2 years. 
                    I decided to take a career break to both spend some time with my young children and also take some time to evaluate 
                    what I wanted to do next.<br><br> Before then I had spent 7 years working for<em>Morgan Stanley</em> in the equities
                    trading department. This was an extremely fast paced role with great emphasis on problem solving, 
                    attention to detail and ability to work to multiple deadlines under great pressure.<br><br> Previous to that I worked 
                    for <em>Pernod Ricard</em> working within the export department. This was a role that required me to work with and
                    coordinate multiple departments in the manufacturing process; with the aim to fulfilling affiliates orders on time.
                    This role involved great organiation, problem solving and customer service skills. </p>

                <h1 id="Cycling">cycling</h1>
                    <p>Mountain biking was my gateway to Cycling (as an adult). We would spend days away at MTB centres in Scotland; mostly the 
                    <strong>7 Stanes</strong> centres at Ae and Mabie Forrest. These rides would take the whole day by the time you travelled 
                    there and back. However once we started a family, that enevitably meant that spending all day Saturday away from the family 
                    wasn't really what I wanted to do (not on a regular basis anyway). It was partly due to this that I made the switch to Road 
                    Cycling, and I have never looked back. I love being on the bike. When I'm not out on a ride, I am thinking about the next time 
                    I will; constantly checking weather forecasts and organising friends to go out with. I use <strong>Strava</strong> to record my rides.</p>

                <h1 id="Music">music</h1>
                    <p>I am constantly listening to music, and am often ‘reprimanded’ for having all the radio’s on in the house at the same time. 
                        I love most types of music, but my specialist subject is <i>’third-division’</i> indie bands. <br><br>I go to as many gigs 
                        as time and money will allow. Recently I’ve been to see Field Music, The Lovely Eggs, Goat Girl, Dutch Uncles and Slug (twice) 
                        amongst others.<br><br>Every year the family all go to the <a href ="http://deershedfestival.com">Deershed</a> festival in North Yorkshire. A 
                        fantastic family friendly 3 day festival that is serious about its music</p>

                <h1 div id="small-header">CodeClan</h1>
                <p>CodeClan are the first digital skills academy in the UK to become a <strong>Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)</strong> approved centre, which is recognised and endorsed by employers across Scotland. The <strong>intensive 16 week course</strong> is designed for career changers, with a view to turning them into job ready Junior Software Developers.</p>
                <p>I have researched the course and have been home studying coding for the last 2 months. It is something that has really gotton under my skin. I love learning syntax principles and writing code which you can instantly see realised in your browser. Initaially I started with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, which I used to build this page.</p></p>
